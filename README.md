The AI Project Feedback Generator is a web-based tool that leverages Google's Gemini API to provide structured, AI-powered feedback on mini project briefs. Designed for students, educators, freelancers, and product teams, the app accepts text input or uploaded files (PDF or TXT) and evaluates the project based on multiple dimensions such as strengths, weaknesses, clarity, and innovation.

Users can select the depth of analysis — Basic, Detailed, or Expert — to customize the tone and comprehensiveness of the feedback. The AI responds with a complete review that includes a short summary, pros and cons, suggestions for improvement, a clarity score (1–10), and an innovation score (1–10).

The application features a modern, responsive UI built with Gradio, and includes additional functionality like:

File upload support for .txt and .pdf briefs



Session history tracking for recent feedback generations

Downloadable AI feedback reports in PDF format

Clean and minimal interface for professional use cases

This tool is especially useful for engineering students submitting mini projects, developers pitching startup ideas, and instructors who want to quickly assess project clarity. It demonstrates the practical use of LLMs for structured qualitative evaluation and is fully open for customization.
